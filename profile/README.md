A project focused on reviving (by recreating) all Microsoft services for Windows 8 (and 8.1), Xbox Live for the original Xbox and Xbox 360, and in the future, Windows Phone, effectively bringing back discontinued Microsoft products.
The aim is to provide a near-perfect multiplayer experience for nearly all games, complete with proper matchmaking and online functionality.
Down the road, weâ€™re also planning to develop our own Xbox 360 emulator and more.
